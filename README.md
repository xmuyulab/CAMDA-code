# The Metagenomics and Metadesign of the Subways and Urban Biomes

### Background
Studies on metagenomic data of environmental microbial samples found that microbial communities seem to be geolocation-specific, and the microbiome abundance profile can be a differentiating feature to identify samples' geolocations. 
In this paper, we present a machine learning framework to determine the geolocations from metagenomics profiling of microbial samples.
